## C3P
#### C3P is a program used to predict the C3 gene in different mammalian species.

#### Description:
#####	 This program improves gene prediction for complement C3 protein of 3 different gene prediction methods - 
#####	 Augustus, FGENESH and GENSCAN. Taking prediction built by these prediction methods, this program 
#####	 identifies the best predicted exons and combines them into new predicted gene, giving exon characteristics,
#####	 coding DNA sequence and encoded protein sequence as output.
